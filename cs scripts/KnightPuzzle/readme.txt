Scripts for a Knight Puzzle game I am developing. It started out as a recruit assignment, but I want to take it a bit further.
You play as a Chess Knight figure on a 6x6 board and have to collect all the coins in a level to win. You can jump over walls, but cannot land on them.

todo: animated knight movement, move counter, in-game level changer, port to Android and iOS, better visual effects, better sound and soundtrack, post level summary, expanded board for further/harder levels, board size chooser, full camera movement.

possibly: dynamic levels with traps, silly/ironic text commentary, different knight figure visual presets (skins), multiple board skins, add the rest of the chess figures with their own unique movement -> add gungame style mode where the figure randomly changes with each move (tetris-like window which shows the next figure in line).
