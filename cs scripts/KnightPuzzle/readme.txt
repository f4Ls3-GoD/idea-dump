Scripts for a Knight Puzzle game I created.
You play as a Chess Knight figure on a 6x6 board and have to collect all the coins in a level to win. You can jump over walls, but cannot land on them.

todo: animated knight movement, move counter, in-game level changer, better visual effects, better sound and soundtrack, post level summary, expanded board for further/harder levels, board size chooser.
possibly: dynamic levels with traps, silly/ironic text commentary, different knight figure visual presets (skins), multiple board skins.
